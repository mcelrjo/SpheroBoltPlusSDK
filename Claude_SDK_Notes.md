Understanding the Connection Process

Scanning for a BOLT:

Filter by advertising name: SB-XXXX (where XXXX is a four-character hex string)
Filter by advertised service UUID: 00010001-574F-4F20-5370-6865726F2121
Optionally filter by RSSI threshold to find the nearest robot


Connecting and Sending Data:

Connect to the device
Use the API Characteristic for sending commands: 00010002-574F-4F20-5370-6865726F2121
First step after connection is to wake the robot


Command Structure:

Every command follows a specific binary protocol with:

Start of Packet (SOP) byte
Header
Payload
Checksum
End of Packet (EOP) byte

SDK Development Plan

Sphero SDK Overview
Connection and Device Discovery

The SDK uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to connect to the Sphero Bolt Plus
It scans for devices with the specified name format (SB-XXXX) and service UUID
Devices are sorted by signal strength to help identify the closest robot

Command Structure Implementation
The SDK handles the complex binary protocol structure:

Constructs proper headers for each command
Builds appropriate payloads
Calculates checksums according to the specification
Frames the packet with the required SOP and EOP bytes

Core Functionality

Device Discovery

scan_for_devices() - Scans for nearby Sphero BOLT devices
Filters by name and service UUID as specified


Connection Management

connect() - Establishes connection to a specific device
disconnect() - Properly terminates the connection
wake() - Sends the wake command (required after connection)


Movement Controls

drive() - Controls robot movement with speed and heading parameters


LED Controls

set_main_led() - Sets the main LED color
set_matrix_led() - Controls the LED matrix (one LED at a time)



Example Usage
The SDK includes an example that:

Scans for available Sphero BOLT devices
Connects to the closest one
Drives the robot in a circle
Changes the main LED colors
Disconnects properly

Next Steps
To continue developing the SDK, consider adding:

Additional Commands

Add more control features like rotation, raw motor control, etc.
Implement sensor reading capabilities


Notification Handling

Add support for receiving sensor data and status updates


Error Handling

Enhance error recovery and reconnection logic
Add timeouts for commands


Documentation

Create detailed API documentation
Add more comprehensive examples


Testing Suite

Develop unit tests and integration tests

Hardware Requirements for Connecting to Sphero Bolt Plus
Minimum Requirements

A device with Bluetooth 4.0+ (BLE - Bluetooth Low Energy) support
Surface Pro models have built-in Bluetooth that supports BLE, so your Surface Pro is compatible

Software Requirements

Python Environment:

Python 3.7 or higher
The SDK uses the bleak library for cross-platform Bluetooth connectivity


Required Python Packages:

bleak: A cross-platform Bluetooth Low Energy client for Python
asyncio: For asynchronous operations (included with Python)



Setup for Surface Pro

Enable Bluetooth:

Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your Surface Pro
Go to Settings → Devices → Bluetooth & other devices
Toggle Bluetooth to "On"


Install Required Software:
powershell# Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
pip install bleak

Prepare the Sphero:

Make sure your Sphero Bolt Plus is charged
Power it on (it should advertise itself via Bluetooth)


Run the SDK:

Save the SDK code to a file (e.g., sphero_sdk.py)
Run it with Python: python sphero_sdk.py



Advantages of Using Surface Pro

Windows Integration: The SDK uses bleak, which works well on Windows
Processing Power: Surface Pro has more than enough computing power for this task
Development Environment: You can use familiar development tools (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
Portability: Surface Pro is portable enough to carry around while testing the robot

No Need for Other Hardware
You don't need:

A Mac (though the SDK would work there too)
A tablet (though you could control it from Android/iOS with different software)
Any special Bluetooth adapters or dongles (your Surface Pro's built-in Bluetooth is sufficient)
